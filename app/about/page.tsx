const topContent = `blogs is a blogging platform I built in June 2025, during a phase when I was diving deep into Next.js and looking to sharpen my full-stack development skills. As a student of Computer Science and someone who learns best by building, I needed a project that was both practical and meaningful, and that&apos;s how blogs came to life.

(by the way you&apos;ll be thinking what this image is doing in the about section, it&apos;s because I like this pic and I took it myself!)`;

const bottomContent = `I had just started learning the ins and outs of Next.js, particularly its powerful App Router, server-side rendering capabilities, and file-based routing system. While tutorials were helpful, I wanted to take it a step further by building something end-to-end â€” something real. This app became that space. A platform where users can write, share, and discover thoughts in a clean, distraction-free environment.

Under the hood, blogs is powered by a modern tech stack: Next.js for the frontend and backend logic, MongoDB as the database, Prisma as the ORM to manage data, and Tailwind CSS for styling the UI. It&apos;s lightweight, responsive, and designed with user experience in mind. Every part of this project helped me understand not just how to connect the dots in a full-stack app, but also how to keep things clean, scalable, and easy to use.

The platform is public â€” anyone can create an account, publish blogs, and interact with others&apos; content. However, the codebase itself remains private, as this project is currently meant for personal learning and demonstration purposes. Still, I&apos;ve made sure it feels professional and polished enough to be used in the real world.

Beyond the tech, this project helped me understand the developer mindset better â€” how important it is to break down features, debug patiently, and iterate based on real usage. Building blogs taught me a lot more than any course could â€” from handling form submissions to managing server responses, database errors, and layout edge cases.

If you&apos;re reading this, thank you for checking out my work. I&apos;m Daksh Thakran, a developer who&apos;s still learning, still building, and always curious. You can explore more of my projects on my GitHub below.`;

          This is just the beginning. I have plans to evolve blogs â€” maybe with user profiles, richer editing tools, filtering options, and more. But for now, I&apos;m proud of this simple platform that reflects both where I am and where I&apos;m going.
